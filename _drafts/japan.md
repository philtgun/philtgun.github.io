Going to Japan from Taiwan is pretty cheap, and it seems strange that for many years of my life in Taiwan I haven't gone there before. However reasons are pretty simple: first there was lack of money, and then there was period with lack of time. Moreover getting visa to Japan for citizens of Ukraine is pain in the ass. But anyway, it finally happened, and here is not-so-long post (hopefully) about adventures in Japan and many visited anime piligrimage sites, what is the primary thread weaving the path that I have taken.
