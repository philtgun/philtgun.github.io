This is one of the first posts on Dungeons & Dragons. For those of you who hear this name first time, D&D it is a pen-and-paper role playing game. The premise is the same as for RPG video games, but with much more freedom (only limits are your imagination) and opportunities for immersive role-playing. However purpose of this post is not to market D&D to new players, but to inspire dungeon/game masters who are already familiar with D&D or other pen-and-paper with ideas for physical props and riddles to hand out to your players and watch them suffer.

Most of the props described below were created for the homebrew Arcanum campaign that was played by D&D 5th edition (next). Homebrew mechanics, lore of original game and other things will not be discussed here (there is too much of data and it is not structured properly). Maybe there will be another post in future addressing those points, if there are people interested in it.

I love creating physical props that I can hand out to my players so they can play with it. It not only helps with immersion, adds different type of activity for players, but also I just like doing DIY projects with materials that are easily accessible from bookshops or dollar stores.

I usually try to achieve good balance between time spent and quality of end product, because it is easy to get carried away and spend whole day on one project. Thus it might be discouraging from starting a project, because you might think that you cannot afford to spend that much time on it due to IRL stuff. Good rule of thumb is 80/20 rule: 20% of time spent corresponds to 80% of actual work done in the beginning, and vice versa in the end. I usually try to follow this rule to not overengineer things and not spend too much time. If it is difficult to estimate, trust your gut instinct and eventually with more practice you will get a good feeling for the trade-off.

## Mystery box

![](/images/dndprops/mystery-box.jpg)

This box wrapped in paper was presented to players as part of the quest for searches of ancient dwarven Iron Clan that disappeared from the face of the continent before the end of the Age of Legends. This riddle works perfectly well in standalone context, but in original Arcanum setting one of the hints was that it is related to technology, thus players might have easier time of coming up with solutions based on their real-world exprerience.

There is a hole in the side of the box, and I told my players not to look inside due to my lack of ideas how to cover it without spending too much effort on it. IF you shake the box, you can hear and feel that there are multiple objects inside. With enough luck you can get one of the objects out by simple intensive shaking, however it will lead to only half of the result.

Because this puzzle requires physical interaction, I will advise to readers who want to solve it by looking at the picture not to spend much time on thinking, because major portion of solving process comes from physical interaction with the object.

### Spoiler

So there are two marbles inside the small labyrinth in the box that are blocked by the movable blocks. The goal is to take out the marbles from the box my moving the blocks. Blocks have magnets inside, so they can be moved by using metal or other magents from outside.
