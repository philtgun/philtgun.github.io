A beginning is half of the work done, right? Well, finally I decided to maintain a blog, where I can share some projects of mine that might be interesting to other people. However, don’t expect eloquent novel-sized passages that appear here weekly.

### What can I expect here?

Nothing. Sometimes (hopefully at least monthly) there might be a new post, but don’t expect much. Topics that definitely will be covered are programming and music, maybe some of Dungeons & Dragons articles/prop ideas and implementations. I will not say that there will be no dank memes or horrible puns, so... you’ve been warned.
