Hello, I am Philip Tovstogan, and this is my website. Currently I am pursuing PhD in [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/) in Universitat Pompeu Fabra. My topic is exploration systems for new music discovery, research interests include music recommendation systems, deep learning and information theory.

I play keyboard and sometimes sing, have been in the rock band during my masters in Taiwan. Have been playing and DMing Dungeons & Dragons for over 10 years, it is a big part of my life. Love hiking and swimming.

Currently I have some articles in my [blog](/blog) and my full [CV](/cv). If you want to contact me, tweet [@philtgun](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@philtgun) or write me an email at _philip.tovstogan (at) upf.edu_.
